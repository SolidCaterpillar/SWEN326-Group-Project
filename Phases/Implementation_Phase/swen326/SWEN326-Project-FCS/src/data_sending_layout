In order to send data between the sockets the flight control system must 
be able to differentiate what data is coming from what module (UI, TESTER, or SIMULATION)
as well as what sensor the data is targeting, and also the value of the data itself.

 - Data is sent in the following message (MSG) format:

MSG    ::= MODULE "=" SENSOR "=" VALUE
MODULE ::= UI | TESTER | SIMULATOR
SENSOR ::= THRUST | ALTITUDE | LATITUDE | LONGITUDE | YAW | PITCH | ROLL
VALUE  ::= \d*.\d*  // any decimal number

Example:
UI=SPEED=500.0
TESTER=THURST=91.5
SIMULATOR=ALTITUDE=20546.586

 - Each module is then sent data back from the FCS that follows
   much the same format as how the data is sent:
   
 1) The UI receives responses (RESP) from the FCS in the following format:

RESP   ::= SENSOR "=" VALUE
SENSOR ::= THRUST | ALTITUDE | LATITUDE | LONGITUDE | YAW | PITCH | ROLL
VALUE  ::= \d*.\d*

 2) The TESTER module receives multiple responses from the FCS. 
   The first is the return code (RETC) of any performed operation, 
   and the second is the state of the sensor before the data was 
   sent along with the state of the sensor after the data 
   processed (DATA_RESPONSE):

RETC        ::= "SUCCESS?" RETURN_CODE
RETURN_CODE ::= 0 | -1 | -2

DATA_RESPONSE ::= VALUE "=" VALUE
VALUE         ::= \d*.\d*

 3) The simulator does
