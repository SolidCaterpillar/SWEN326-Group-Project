In order to send data between the sockets the flight control system must 
be able to differentiate what data is coming from what sensor, and also 
what the data is updating, e.g. the thrust.

So we could send the data by first saying what is being updated, followed 
by a '=' and then the actual value of the update:

SPEED=500.0
THRUST=186.5
ALTITUDE=20340.00
LATITUDE=53.34
LONGITUDE=-35.00
YAW=145.00
PITCH=25.78
ROLL=55.09

// pseudo code for it receiving data

String recv = this.in.readLine();
String[] arr = recv.split("=");
assert arr.length == 2;

if (arr[1].charAt(0) == '-')
	is negative number 

return arr[1].toNumber
