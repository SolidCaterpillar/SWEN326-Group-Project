# Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP)
## Assurance Metrics and Measurements:
### Spot Bugs & Checkstyle                                  
- Utilise spotbugs during development to abide by the Power of Ten rule. Ensuring each member follows the same style and coding conventions. 

## Quality Assurance Activities:
### Peer Reviewing
- We will utilise peer reviewing, where we shall have our code checked by at least 1 other member to ensure the code is bug free.

## Quality Assurance Processes:
### Documentation:
- Each team member must document their code using Javadoc comments to communicate the usage of classes and methods.
- Members should document their development process in a written form that is clear to other team members.

## Schedule: 
- At regular weekly intervals, the entire code will be tested both on the personal laptops as well as the ECS University Systems to ensure quality
- The testing reviews will be presented to the team
