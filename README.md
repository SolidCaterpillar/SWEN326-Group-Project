### Run the Project

To develop the system we used **Eclipse**.

P.S. If the `SWEN326-Project-FCS` package comes with an error in eclipse:
1. Right Click and click on `Build Path` then `Configure Build Path`
2. Double click on the file underneath `Class Path`
3. Navigate to the root directory of this repository and select the `.jar` file
4. Click on `Apply and Close`

Run these Java Files in the same following order:

1. `/Phases/Implementation_Phase/swen326/SWEN326-Project-FCS/src/fcs/FlightController.java`
2. `/Phases/Implementation_Phase/swen326/SWEN326-Project-Simulator/src/Simulator.java`
3. `/Phases/Implementation_Phase/swen326/SWEN326-Project-Tester/src/test/Tester.java `    as JUnit Test
4. `/Phases/Implementation_Phase/swen326/SWEN326-Project-UI/src/ui/UI.java`
