### Run the Project

Run these Java Files in the same following order:

1. `/Phases/Implementation_Phase/swen326/SWEN326-Project-FCS/src/fcs/FlightController.java`
2. `/Phases/Implementation_Phase/swen326/SWEN326-Project-Simulator/src/Simulator.java`
3. `/Phases/Implementation_Phase/swen326/SWEN326-Project-Tester/src/test/Tester.java `    as JUnit Test
4. `/Phases/Implementation_Phase/swen326/SWEN326-Project-UI/src/ui/UI.java`

To develop the system we used **Eclipse**.
